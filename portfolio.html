    <h1>   Tic Tac Turtle. pltw 1.1.9</h1>
	<img src="Images/Tic Tac Turtle1.JPG" height="200">
	<img src="Images/Tic Tac Turtle2.JPG" height="200">
<br>
	<p> This project was about making a two player game around the idea of Tic Tac Toe.
Since we are using a turtle to draw the board, we decided to make special twist of this game by
calling it Tic Tac Turtle instead.</p>

    <h1>   Used Replit to make 1.2.5 game Target Arrow game</h1>
	<img src="Images/Target Arrow 1.PNG" height="200">
	<img src="Images/Target Arrow 2.PNG" height="200">
<br>
	<p> This project had a moving projectile as the target, and the arrow would shoot "onkeyclick."
this has the twist that every time you miss, the arrow will spawn in a different area along the y-axis. </p>

    <h1>   1.3.1 E-Card project!</h1>
		  <img src="Images/R2D2 Ecard.PNG" height="200"> <br>
	<p> This project was a simple clicking animation, where when the user clicks on the death star, the millenium falcon comes over and shoots it.
		Since the droid R2D2 has a lot of buttons, we used two and made a central red button tell a joke, and the grey button next to it reveal the answer. </p>

    <h1>   Scratch game!.</h1>
	<img src="Images/scratch project 1.PNG" height="200">
	<img src="Images/scratch project 2.PNG" height="200">
	<p> This project was about making a game using Scratch. We made a game that had a similar idea to Fruit Ninja
in that the shark had to eat the fish and about getting caught. We implemented a score system and different costumes for
each of the many characters we had in the game. </p>
	<h1>3.1.6 pltw project</h1>
	<img src="Images/3_1_6 picture.PNG" height="200">
	<p> This project is about analyzing the regional data to determine the project results. By comparing the data with regional descriptions we were able to determine our conclusion
that the area the rover is in is Inland.<p/>

    <h1>   4.1.4 pltw project - simulation 3D solids</h1>
    <br>
	<p> This project simulated real world models and showcased the skills of problem solving in terms of relating simulations to real-world issues.
As a result, the simulations can help scientists understand how their 3D models will be applicable.</p>
